Mario Tutuncu-Macias (Period 4)

We want to make a gif "explaining" integration. We will plot a curve and increase the number rectangles in the gif.

# Additional Features

## User input for polynomials and range of integration (happens immediately after typing make)

## Dynamically modifying the script for the number of rectangles (will increase to show the area counted is approaching the total area)

## Make a draw polynomial function as a gif (will first determine how to scale the axis, then will plot each x value and connect with line commands)

## Display and calculate area of integration (counting pixels of the positive color, subtracting the negative color, and scaling the number to get the integral)
